Contractual agreements with third parties, such as insurance companies or outsourcers, must be signed, specifying the level of responsibility each actor has in the event of the risk materializing. The decision to transfer the risks must be driven by the Risk Owner and informed or raised for decision by the relevant stakeholders, depending on the strategic relevance of the activity. Avoid/Terminate The residual risk is considered unacceptable, and the costs of trying to reduce it or transferring it are not reasonable or worth the effort. Therefore, the asset or process that generates the risk must be terminated. The scenario to terminate any given activity due to the level of risk must be thoroughly analysed for

The impact must be based on at least one of the following categories. In the event that more than one category is assessed, the level of impact will be based on the one with the highest value.

Some threats may affect more than one asset. In some cases, they may cause different impacts depending on the assets that are affected. • 
Information can be obtained by reviewing incidents, gathering from 
 elements (e.g., asset owners, users, technical teams) and analysing other sources, including external threat catalogues.
• 
Relevant threats are constantly evolving, especially if the business environment or information systems change. As a result of performing this task, a list of threats that can be exploited by vulnerabilities, associated with each asset under analysis, is obtained. Controls identification

eptable, and it is deemed necessary to reduce it by means of one or more treatment measures, which could be implemented internally or by another area. These treatment measures must be formally stated and monitored in the risk register to guarantee the desired result of decreasing the residual risk levels. Initiatives or projects that address risks of special relevance to the organization, must receive special attention and be periodically reported on their progress to the top management. Transfer The residual risk is considered a liability, and it is deemed necessary to have a guarantee that, in the event of it materializing, the organization is reasonably covered. Contractual agreements with third parties, such as insurance companies or outsourcers, must be signed,
